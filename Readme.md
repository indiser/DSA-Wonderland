# 🚀 The Algorithm Playground

Welcome to the chaotic wonderland of data structures and algorithms! This is where sorting algorithms go to party, graphs get tangled, and recursion calls itself into oblivion.

## 📂 What's Inside This Madness?

### 🔄 **BFS/** - Breadth-First Shenanigans
Level order traversals, rotten oranges spreading like gossip, snakes and ladders, and word ladders. It's basically a graph party where everyone gets visited level by level.

### 🌳 **Binary Tree/** - Tree Vibes
Inverted trees (because sometimes you need to flip things upside down) and finding max values. It's like a family tree, but with code.

### 🔗 **c programming/** - The OG Classics
Where it all started. Linked lists and hello worlds. Respect the classics.

### 🎯 **c++ programming/** - The Main Event
THE MEGA FOLDER. 150+ files of pure algorithmic chaos:
- **Sorting**: Bubble, Merge, Quick, Heap, Insertion, Selection (pick your poison)
- **Searching**: Binary, Linear, 2D matrices (they're hiding everywhere)
- **Arrays**: 2D arrays, subarrays, inversions, duplicates (find 'em all!)
- **Strings**: Anagrams, palindromes, substrings (they're tricky)
- **Linked Lists**: Cycles, reversals, merging (untangle the mess)
- **Math Stuff**: Pow, sqrt, roman numerals (because why not?)
- **Classics**: N-Queens, Sudoku, Knight's Tour (the brain-melters)
- **And more**: Bitwise ops, hash tables, vectors, sets (the kitchen sink)

### 💪 **Dynamic Programming/** - The Optimization Wizards
Climbing stairs, edit distances, longest subsequences. Where brute force goes to cry.

### 🕸️ **Graph/** - The Tangled Web
Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Kruskal, Prim, Floyd-Warshall, A* search. Cycles, components, shortest paths. It's a graph party and everyone's invited.

### 🎲 **Priority Queue/** - The VIP Section
Relative ranks and other queue shenanigans.

### 🔀 **Recursion&BackTracking/** - The Spiral Zone
Permutations, combinations, subsets, mazes, cryptarithmetic. Where functions call themselves and somehow it works.

### 🔤 **Trie/** - The Word Wizard
Autocomplete, word search, prefix matching. It's like a dictionary, but make it code.

## 🎮 How to Use This Playground

1. Pick a folder that sounds fun
2. Find a `.cpp` or `.c` file that catches your eye
3. Compile it (or just run the `.exe` if you're feeling lazy)
4. Watch the magic happen ✨

## 📊 By The Numbers

- **~200+ C++ files** (because one algorithm is never enough)
- **~50+ Graph algorithms** (we really like graphs)
- **~40+ Recursion problems** (stack overflow not included)
- **~30+ DP solutions** (optimization is our love language)
- **Countless .exe files** (proof that it all compiles... sometimes)

## 🎪 The Vibe

This is a learning playground. It's messy, it's beautiful, it's got typos in the filenames (looking at you, `polindrom.cpp`), and it's absolutely packed with algorithmic goodness. Whether you're prepping for interviews, learning new concepts, or just vibing with code, there's something here for you.

**Pro tip**: Don't look too closely at the code quality. We're here for the algorithms, not the aesthetics. 😄

Happy coding! May your recursion be deep and your graphs be connected. 🚀
